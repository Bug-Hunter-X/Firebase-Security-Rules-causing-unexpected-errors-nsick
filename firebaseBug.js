The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the rules in your Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore are too restrictive or incorrectly configured. For example, if your rules prevent read or write access for specific users or data, your application might encounter unexpected errors. This can be difficult to debug since the error messages aren't always clear. Ensure that your rules allow the necessary access based on authentication and security considerations.
