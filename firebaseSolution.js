The solution involves carefully reviewing and adjusting your Firebase security rules.  Ensure that your rules grant the necessary access based on authentication and the data you're working with.

Here is an example of more permissive rules:

```
// Security Rules for Firestore
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true; // This is for demonstration purposes only. DO NOT use this in production without proper authentication!
    }
  }
}
```

Remember to replace `true` with appropriate authentication and authorization checks in your production rules.  Always prioritize security and carefully design your rules to control access precisely.
