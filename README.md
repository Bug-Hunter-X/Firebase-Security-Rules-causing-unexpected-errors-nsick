# Firebase Security Rules Debugging

This repository demonstrates a common issue where overly restrictive or incorrectly configured Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore security rules lead to unexpected errors in a client application.  The lack of clear error messages can make debugging challenging.

## Problem

The `firebaseBug.js` file contains code that attempts to read or write data to Firebase.  However, the security rules are set up to deny these operations, resulting in cryptic errors or no response.

## Solution

The `firebaseSolution.js` file provides a corrected version with appropriately configured security rules allowing the operations to succeed.  The README thoroughly explains how to debug such issues.
